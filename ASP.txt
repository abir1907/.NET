ASP.NET controls:

A) Standard controls
	1) Intrinsic controls
	2) Rich Controls: Adrotator, calender Controls
B) Data controls
C) Validation


Checkboxlist: DataBaseID
IsPostBack is a property of Page class.
Page is a super class of ASP.NET

Multiview: collection of different views


Validation summary

event bubbling- whenever you add your own control within data control, when you click your own control but fires the event of the data control

Types of ASP.NET objects:
1. Request: Whenever client sends a request to the server
2. Response: object of Page class. Whenever server generates a PostBack to the client
3. Session: object that can access the data between page call
4. Application: object that can access the data in whole application
5. Server: We can access the resources of the server

SMS:
1. Clients side
i) viewstate: we can access the data within page. Type is hidden, storage type collections.data store is encrypted format.
ii) HiddenField: We can access the data within page. Storage type single value. Data does not store encrypted format.
iii) Cross page posting: We can access the data one page to another only control value.
iv) Querystring: we can access the data one page to another using URL.
v) Cookies: We can access the data one page to any page. default time 30 days. max data 4kb.

Response.Redirect: redirect to another page follow the round trip, URL changed
Server.Transfer: directly redirect to another page, does not follow round trip, URL unchanged

ADO.NET
DataAdapter methods -Fill,FillSchema
Dataset is an object that can be used to retrieve the data from database 
Dataset just like RDBMS
Data is stored in XML format in Dataset
Dataset is collection of datatable and datatable is a collection of datarow and datacolumn.

Datarelation is an object 
Dataview is an object that can be used to filtering and sorting the data
constraint cannot be copied.

CommandBuilder: provides the permission to the adapter to fetch the data from disconnected mode and update in connected mode




Data Controls: We can dynamic bind the data in data controls
DOTNET 1.1:
1) Repeater Controls: Repeater Control is a container but repeater control does not have any format. 
How to create the format of repeater control: using different template we can create.
2) DataList: Same as repeater
Difference: repeater control is a read only control but we can edit the data in datalist.
3) DataGrid: it has its own format. we can edit the data in datagrid.

DOTNET 2.0:
1) GridView
2) FormView
3) DetailView

DOTNET 3.5:
1) ListView
2) DataPager


How to bind data in detailView?
Difference between eval and bind?
eval - single way binding
bind - two way binding


---------------------------------------

form tag method- 'Get' by default
Difference between Get and Post: In Get, data show in URL, In Post data not shown. Get is not secured. Post is secured. Limited data transfer using Get.
Maximum data transfer using post.
file upload control: inside form tag, write: enctype="multipart/form-data"
view type: hidden
-----------------------------------
In DataReader, data stored in binary format.
In DataSet, data stored in XML format.

How to execute procedure in front end?
using System.Data;
cmd=new SqlCommand("procedure_name",con);
cmd.CommandType=CommandType.StoredProcedure;

OR

cmd=new SqlCommand("exec procedure_name '"+TextBox1.Text+"'",con);
-----------------------------------
Configuration file:
data stored in XML format.
1. Machine.config
2. Web.config
We can use more than web.config in one project with the help of directory.

How to put connection in web.config?
<configuration>
	<connectionStrings>
		<add name="constr" connectionStrings="<servername>; database=crm;integrated security=true" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
	</connectionStrings>
</configuration>

SqlConnection con=new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["constr"].ToString());


aspx page- Inline code
cs page- code behind code

-----------------------------------------------------
1. connection string in web.config
2. DAL- add class file
App_Data- database
App_code- cs file
--------------------------------
Webuser control- access within website. extension- .ascx (Active Server Control)
custom control- access multiple website. extension- .dll
We have to reduce lot of coding and designing by using webuser control and custom control

How to call webuser control?
by using Register directive(<%@ Register%>)
<TagPrefix:Tagname
------------------------

Webservice are the business logic component that provides the functionality by the internet
extension- .asmx
SOA - Service Oriented Architecture

webservice consumes in various way: 
1) http get: whenever URL get the method 
2) http post: whenever server generates postback to the client
3) soap: lightweight protocol used for transferring the data in a platform independent way. access to services, server and object
4) wsdl:Web Service Description Language. If you want to see the metadata, type , description 

System.Web.Services- namespace
WebService- class

disco file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AJAX is a combination of Asynchronous JS and XML. Technique for creating better, faster and more attractive web application. it stops the whole page refreshment for each postback. XMLHttpRequest object trades data with web application


We can use only one scriptManager within one webpage but updatePanel more than one.

----------------------------------
Master Page
Overall layer of application that can be stored in master page.
.master is the extension
By default two placeholders

How to call a masterpage in your page?

In web.config 
<system.web>
	<pages masterPageFile="<name>" />
</system.web>
--------------------------------
Navigation control:
treeview
Menu
Sitemap: SiteMap path.... open Web.sitemap
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Themes
.css- design time, applied for any control
.skin- runtime,applied for server control
1. default skin- no skin id, by default applies for same control
2. Named skin- has skin id.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
How to pick querystring?
request.querystring
---------------------------
How to install IIS Server?
control panel -> Programs and features -> turn windows feature on and off -> c:\inetpub\wwwroot

How to configure IIS in VS?
VS Command Prompt -> run as administrator -> aspnet_regiis -i

Before deployment website in IIS server, first you have to publish
whenever you upload a website to the server, create a virtual directory

inetmgr - shortcut for IIS

-------------------------------
<Configuration>
	<system.net>
		<mailSettings>
			<smtp>
				
			</smtp>
		</mailSettings>
	</system.net>
</configuration>


namespace: using System.Net.Mail
MailMessage mm=new MailMessage()
mm.Attachment.Add(new Attachment(FileUpload1.PostedFile.InputStream,""))
SmtpClient sc=new SmtpClient();
sc.EnablesSsl=true;
sc.Send(ms);
--------------------------

LINQ- Unified programming model to access any kind of data.
LINQ with object
LINQ with database
LINQ with XML
LINQ with Dataset

System.Data.LINQ

--------------------
Global.asax- all the global application label event stored in the global.asax. within a project we can use one global.asax

Session mode- Proc, InProc, state server/ outproc, database,custom

-------------------

Entity Framework
Open source framework
ORM- object relational mapping
three approaches- code first, database first, model first

namespace - System.Data.Entity

edmx - entity framework extension

table denotes class
column denotes property
stored procedure denotes function

Code first approach: Business layer first

-------------------
MVC:
it is an architecture pattern. 
No code behind, No viewstate

Razor engine extension - .cshtml
@ in Razor engine
<% in aspx engine

namespace for mvc- system.web.Mvc;

-----------------

Security in web.config
diff between 

Authentication: We have to define the number of users 
Authorization: is the process where we check does this identity have access right to the system.

Type of Authentication mode in web.config:
1. Form: used for internet application
2. Windows: used for intranet application
3. Passport: if you want to provide a higher security. For this we have to download the passport development kit from MS website and install in computer
4. None

By default which type of Authentication mode used in web.config? -> Windows

--------------------

Connectivity with LINQ

.dbml is the extension od LINQ with database
to connect with database click on server explorer
